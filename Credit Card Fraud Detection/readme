🌸 Task 5 – Credit Card Fraud Detection 

This project involved detecting fraudulent credit card transactions from highly imbalanced datasets using machine learning classification. Key steps included data 
preprocessing with SMOTE for class imbalance, exploratory data analysis (EDA) on anonymized PCA features (V1-V28), transaction amounts, and building models like Logistic Regression, 
Random Forest, and XGBoost to classify genuine vs fraudulent transactions.

Practical experience gained in handling imbalanced classification problems, anomaly detection, and evaluating models using Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC metrics to minimize financial losses from fraud.
