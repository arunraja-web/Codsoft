🎬 Task 2 – Movie Rating Prediction Model
This project involved data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and building regression models to predict movie ratings using Python. Through this task, I gained hands-on experience in understanding real-world datasets and applying machine learning techniques.
Excited to continue working on the upcoming tasks 🚀📊

Tech Stacks: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
