🌸 Task 3 – Iris Flower Classification Model Successfully completed.

This project involved data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection, and building classification models to predict the species of Iris flowers using Python. Through this task, I gained practical experience in handling classification problems and understanding how different machine learning algorithms perform on structured datasets.
Excited to move forward with the next tasks 🚀📈

Tech Stacks: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
